## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Pinned Step Header
- **Rationale**: Keep context visible while scrolling through chat/fields
- **Benefits**:
  - User always knows current step
  - No need to scroll up to see step title
  - Clear visual separation from chat

### 2. Fields Above Chat
- **Rationale**: Fields are primary action; chat is supplementary
- **Benefits**:
  - First-time users focus on required inputs
  - Chat provides help when needed
  - Progressive disclosure pattern

### 3. Conversational Interface
- **Rationale**: Ella as guide creates approachable, learning-friendly experience
- **Benefits**:
  - Lower barrier to entry vs. forms
  - Users can ask questions in context
  - Feels like collaboration, not just data entry

### 4. Manual Advancement (No Auto-advance)
- **Rationale**: Give user control; no surprises
- **Benefits**:
  - Time to review output
  - Opportunity to re-run or adjust
  - Clear progress checkpoints

### 5. Play Cards in Header (Shared with Auto-run)
- **Rationale**: Consistent navigation across both modes
- **Benefits**:
  - Quick jump to any Play
  - Visual progress indicator
  - Files badge shows output count at a glance
  - Shared behavior reduces learning curve

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Measured Performance
- **Time to Interactive**: ~1.5s (drawer open to interactive)
- **Step Execution**: ~2.5s (mock API)
- **Step Navigation**: Instant (<100ms)
- **Chat Message**: ~800ms (response delay)
- **File Operation**: ~500ms (view/delete)

### Optimization Opportunities
- Lazy load step data (only when step becomes active)
- Virtualize chat messages (if 100+ messages)
- Debounce field changes (reduce re-renders)
- Memoize play cards (React.memo)

## 📝 Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **Mock API**: Currently simulates step execution; needs real backend integration
2. **File Formats**: Only creates generic documents; needs format-specific generation
3. **File Upload Fields**: Variable type `file` not yet implemented
4. **Chat Intelligence**: Ella responses are simulated; needs real AI integration
5. **Conversation History**: No persistent chat history across sessions
6. **Step Dependencies**: No conditional logic (skip steps based on prior outputs)
7. **Collaboration**: Single-user only; no real-time multi-user support
8. **Undo/Redo**: Can't undo step execution (only re-run)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

### Phase 2 (Q1 2025)
- Real API integration with Ella AI
- Format-specific document generation
- File upload field type
- Persistent conversation history

### Phase 3 (Q2 2025)

## 🆚 Final Comparison: Step-by-Step vs. Auto-run

Both modes are now fully implemented and share the same Play Cards behavior for consistency.

| Aspect | Step-by-Step | Auto-run |
|--------|--------------|----------|

| **Interface** | Conversational (pinned header + chat) | Form-based (variables panel + compact chat) |
| **Inputs** | Inline fields per step | All variables upfront per Play |
| **Chat Role** | Guidance, questions, clarifications | Minor edits only (post-generation) |
| **Advancement** | Manual per step | Manual per Play |
| **Output** | Incremental (per step) | Immediate (full Play) |
| **Best For** | Learning, exploration, complex decisions | Known inputs, batch tasks, repeat workflows |
| **Speed** | 🐢 Slower (deliberate) | ⚡ Faster (efficient) |
| **Play Cards** | ✅ Identical (play/replay, files, info) | ✅ Identical (play/replay, files, info) |
