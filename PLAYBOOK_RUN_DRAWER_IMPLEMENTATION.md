## Usage

### Opening the Run Drawer

The PlaybookRunDrawer is opened when a user clicks "Run" on a playbook in the DocumentDrawer (Preview mode):

```jsx
// In DocumentDrawer
<button onClick={handleEdit}>
  {isPlaybookContext ? 'Run' : 'Edit'}
</button>

// handleEdit calls onRunPlaybook prop
const handleEdit = () => {
  if (isPlaybookContext && onRunPlaybook) {
    onRunPlaybook(document);
  }
  // ...
};
```

### Integration in Workspace

```jsx
// Workspace.jsx
import PlaybookRunDrawer from '../components/features/PlaybookRunDrawer';

const [isPlaybookRunDrawerOpen, setIsPlaybookRunDrawerOpen] = useState(false);
const [playbookRunData, setPlaybookRunData] = useState(null);

const handleRunPlaybook = (documentData) => {
  setIsDocumentDrawerOpen(false);
  setPlaybookRunData(documentData);
  setIsPlaybookRunDrawerOpen(true);
};

<PlaybookRunDrawer
  isOpen={isPlaybookRunDrawerOpen}
  onClose={handleClosePlaybookRunDrawer}
  playbook={playbookRunData?.playbook || null}
  inputPanelData={playbookRunData?.inputPanelData || null}
/>
```

## Data Structure

### Playbook Object
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: 'Playbook Name',
  plays: [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: 'Play Name',
      steps: [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: 'Step Name',
          description: 'Step description...',
          fields: [
            {
              id: 'field_id',
              label: 'Field Label',
              type: 'text|textarea|date|select|number|boolean|file|url',
              required: true|false,
              options: ['Option 1', 'Option 2'] // for select type
            }
          ],
          isOutput: true|false // true for final aggregation step
        }
      ],
      documents: [] // Filled during execution
    }
  ]
}
```

### Input Panel Data (from Preview Drawer)
```javascript
{
  workspaceId: 1,
  projectId: 2,
  icps: ['ICP 1', 'ICP 2'], // or "all"
  instructions: 'Special instructions...',
  fileIds: [1, 2, 3]
}
```

## Styling

The component uses theme variables for consistent theming:
- `--theme-bg-primary`, `--theme-bg-secondary`, `--theme-bg-tertiary`
- `--theme-text-primary`, `--theme-text-secondary`, `--theme-text-muted`
- `--theme-border-primary`, `--theme-border-secondary`
- `--theme-primary`, `--theme-primary-hover`, `--theme-primary-alpha`
- `--theme-success`, `--theme-error`, `--theme-warning`

Responsive design:
- Mobile: Full width drawer
- Desktop: 900px max width
- Adaptive layouts for small screens

## Future Enhancements

### Out of Scope (Current Ticket)
- Auto-Run mode (execute all steps automatically)
- Input Panel UI (assumes data comes from separate component)
- Real API integration (currently using mock data)
- Document viewer in left pane split view
- File upload handling
- Multi-select and complex field types
- Rich text editing in outputs
- Export/download of completed playbook runs

### Potential Improvements
1. **Step Templates** - Pre-fill common step configurations
2. **Branching Logic** - Conditional steps based on previous outputs
3. **Parallel Execution** - Run multiple steps/plays concurrently
4. **Version Control** - Track playbook run versions
5. **Collaboration** - Multi-user playbook execution
6. **Analytics Dashboard** - Visualize playbook performance metrics
7. **Scheduling** - Run playbooks on a schedule
8. **Webhooks** - Trigger external actions on step completion

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Open drawer from DocumentDrawer "Run" button
- [ ] Navigate through all steps using Next/Previous
- [ ] Fill in required fields and validate Run button enablement
- [ ] Execute a step and verify output display
- [ ] Verify auto-advance to next step
- [ ] Complete a Play and advance to next Play
- [ ] Run Again (Create New) on a completed Play
- [ ] Expand/collapse step descriptions
- [ ] Expand/collapse Play document lists
- [ ] Send chat messages and receive responses
- [ ] Complete all plays and see completion screen
- [ ] Click "Continue chatting with Ella"
- [ ] Click "Exit Playbook"
- [ ] Close drawer mid-run and verify Save & Close modal
- [ ] Restore saved session (refresh page and check localStorage)
- [ ] Test Escape key handling
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify telemetry logging in console

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty playbook (no plays)
- [ ] Play with no steps
- [ ] Step with no fields
- [ ] Very long step descriptions
- [ ] Very long chat messages
- [ ] Many plays (horizontal scroll)
- [ ] Many documents per play
- [ ] Network errors during execution
- [ ] Browser refresh mid-execution
- [ ] Multiple drawer instances
- [ ] Theme switching

## Accessibility Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- ✅ Focus indicators on all interactive elements
- ✅ ARIA labels and roles
- ✅ Color contrast meets 4.5:1 ratio (using theme variables)
- ✅ Text scalability (uses rem units)
- ✅ Screen reader announcements for progress updates
- ✅ Focus trap within drawer
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure

## Performance Considerations

- Step state is memoized per step key to avoid re-renders
- Chat messages filtered by current step for efficient rendering
- Auto-scroll uses RAF for smooth performance
- Progress bar animations use CSS transforms (GPU accelerated)
- Large lists use virtual scrolling considerations
- LocalStorage operations are async-wrapped for error handling

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all fields
- XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
- No eval() or dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- File uploads respect workspace ACLs (when implemented)
- localStorage access wrapped in try-catch
- Telemetry data sanitized before logging

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
- Mobile Safari 14+
- Chrome for Android 90+

## Dependencies

No new dependencies required. Uses existing:
- React 18+
- SCSS with theme variables
- Standard browser APIs (localStorage, clipboard)
